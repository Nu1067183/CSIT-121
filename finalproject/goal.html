    <h2>Future Goals and Career Aspirations</h2>
    
    <p>As I progress through my dental hygiene program, my short-term goal is to complete my Associate Degree by May 2025 and successfully pass the national board examinations. I am committed to gaining as much clinical experience as possible during my studies to develop my skills and confidence in providing exceptional patient care.</p>
    
    <p>In the long term, I aspire to obtain a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Dental Hygiene and become a registered dental hygienist. I aim to work in a private practice where I can apply my knowledge to improve patient outcomes through preventive care and education. Furthermore, I am passionate about advocating for underserved populations and plan to volunteer in various community health initiatives and refugee camps. I believe that access to quality oral healthcare is a fundamental right, and I am dedicated to making a positive impact in the lives of individuals who may not otherwise receive it.</p>
    
    <p>Ultimately, I envision a career where I not only provide direct patient care but also contribute to the advancement of the dental hygiene profession through education and community outreach. I am eager to embrace lifelong learning and stay informed about the latest research and developments in the field, ensuring that I continue to grow both personally and professionally throughout my career.</p>
