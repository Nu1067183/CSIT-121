    <h2>Future Goals and Career Aspirations</h2>
    
    <p>As I progress through my dental hygiene program, my short-term goal is to complete my Associate Degree by May 2025 and successfully pass the national board examinations. I am committed to gaining as much clinical experience as possible during my studies to develop my skills and confidence in providing exceptional patient care.<p/>

<p>In the long term, I aspire to work in a private practice where I can apply my knowledge to improve patient outcomes through preventive care and education. I am also passionate about traveling the world and volunteering in refugee camps, providing essential oral healthcare to underserved populations. I believe that access to quality care is a fundamental right, and I am committed to making a positive impact on individuals who may not have the opportunity to receive proper dental treatment.<p/>

<p>Ultimately, I aim to build a career where I can provide patient care while also contributing to the growth of the dental hygiene profession through education and community outreach.</p>
