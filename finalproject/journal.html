            <p class="entry-body">In the beginning of my dental hygiene journey, I faced some challenges with time management as I adjusted to the demands of the program. It was difficult to balance my coursework, clinical hours, and personal life. However, by developing a more structured schedule and prioritizing my tasks, I gradually improved my ability to manage my time effectively. This experience taught me the importance of planning ahead and staying organized.</p>

            <p class="entry-title">Entry 2: Mastering Clinical Skills</p>
            <p class="entry-body">One of the most rewarding aspects of the program has been refining my clinical skills. Initially, I struggled with performing certain procedures, such as scaling and root planing. With the guidance of my instructors and consistent practice, I became more confident in my abilities. This experience reinforced the importance of persistence and continuous learning in the clinical setting.</p>

            <p class="entry-title">Entry 3: Building Patient Rapport</p>
            <p class="entry-body">Establishing trust and rapport with patients has been another essential part of my journey. Early on, I found it challenging to communicate effectively with patients, especially those who were anxious about dental procedures. By actively listening, showing empathy, and providing reassurance, I was able to create a more comfortable environment for my patients. This experience highlighted the importance of strong communication skills in patient care.</p>
