            <h2>Clinical Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                My clinical experiences have been incredibly rewarding and instrumental in shaping my journey as a dental hygiene student. I have had the opportunity to provide preventive care and treatment for patients of all ages, including those with special needs. These experiences have taught me the importance of  adaptability, and delivering patient-centered care tailored to the unique needs of each individual.

                Under the supervision of my instructors, I have also had the opportunity to administer local anesthesia, which has enhanced my technical skills and ability to manage patient comfort during procedures.

                Another key clinical experience involved conducting a detailed nutritional assessment for a patient. This included evaluating their dietary habits and implementing personalized recommendations to improve their oral health. The process was both challenging and rewarding. It gave me the opportunity to witness directly how personalized advice can make a significant difference in improving oral health outcomes.. Below is the full report of the nutritional assessment:</p>
