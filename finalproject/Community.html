        <p>I had the opportunity to contribute by decorating the day before the event, setting up operatories, and assisting clinician students during the event by sterilizing instruments and maintaining a smooth workflow. This experience gave me valuable insights into teamwork and the importance of preparation in providing excellent patient care.</p>

         <p>I had the privilege of working alongside interpreting students to provide preventive dental services to members of the deaf community. This experience helped me develop a deeper understanding of the unique needs of diverse patient populations and the importance of fostering inclusive care environments.</p>
